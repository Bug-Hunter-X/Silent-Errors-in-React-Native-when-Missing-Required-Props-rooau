This repository demonstrates a common but silent bug in React Native development: the failure to provide required props to components.  The bug is challenging to debug because it doesn't always produce a clear error message in the console.  The solution involves carefully checking component documentation and ensuring all required props are passed. The example uses a simple custom component but highlights a problem that can occur with any component, especially third-party libraries.
